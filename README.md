Python Class Exam - Code Explanation
Overview
This repository contains the solution for the Python class exam. The code answers several questions related to colour frequencies, Fibonacci sequence, and database operations. Below is a breakdown of each question and its corresponding code implementation.

Questions and Answers
1. Mean Colour
The mean colour refers to the average frequency of all the colours worn throughout the week. The program calculates the mean by first counting the occurrence of each colour, then finding the average of these frequencies. The result is rounded to two decimal places for clarity.

Explanation:
The mean is calculated using the following formula:

Mean
=
Sum of all colour frequencies
Number of distinct colours
Mean= 
Number of distinct colours
Sum of all colour frequencies
​
 
2. Most Worn Colour
The most worn colour is the one with the highest frequency of appearance across the entire week. This is determined by finding the colour with the largest frequency count from the list of all colours.

Explanation:
We create a dictionary to store each colour and its corresponding frequency, then use the max function to find the colour with the highest frequency.

3. Median Colour
The median colour is determined by sorting the colours by their frequencies and selecting the middle value. If there is an even number of colours, the median is the average of the two middle values.

Explanation:
We sort the colours by frequency and find the middle element in the sorted list. The median is particularly useful for understanding the central tendency of the colours.

4. Variance of Colours
Variance measures the spread of colour frequencies. It tells us how much the colour frequencies deviate from the mean. The formula for variance is:

Variance
=
∑
(
𝑥
−
𝜇
)
2
𝑛
Variance= 
n
∑(x−μ) 
2
 
​
 
where 
𝑥
x is each frequency, 
𝜇
μ is the mean, and 
𝑛
n is the number of colours.

Explanation:
The program calculates the variance by first determining the difference between each colour's frequency and the mean, squaring that difference, summing them all, and dividing by the number of colours.

5. Probability of Red Colour
The probability of randomly selecting the colour red is calculated by dividing the frequency of red by the total number of colours worn during the week. The result is expressed as a decimal.

Explanation:
The probability is given by the formula:

Probability of Red
=
Frequency of Red
Total number of colours
Probability of Red= 
Total number of colours
Frequency of Red
​
 
This helps us understand the likelihood of choosing the colour red randomly from the list of all colours.

Im so sorry i simply didn't do the ones i had not much idea on
7. Recursive Search Algorithm
The recursive search algorithm is designed to search for a specific number in a list. It works by repeatedly dividing the list into smaller sub-lists until the target number is found or the end of the list is reached.

Explanation:
This recursive function takes the list, target number, and index as arguments. It checks if the number at the current index matches the target. If not, it calls itself with the next index. The process continues until the target is found or the list is exhausted.

8. Random 4-Digit Binary Number to Base 10
   --------------------------------------

9.Fibonacci Sequence Sum
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The program calculates the sum of the first 50 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

Explanation:
We start with the first two numbers (0 and 1), and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. The program continues this process for 50 iterations and sums the numbers.

Conclusion
This repository demonstrates how to solve a series of Python programming problems using various data structures, algorithms, and libraries. The explanations provided offer an understanding of how the code works to solve each problem.
